# rock_paper_scissors

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a game in which each player simultaneously shows one of three hand signals representing rock, paper, or scissors. Rock beats scissors. Scissors beats paper. Paper beats rock.
The player who shows the first option that beats the other player's option wins.
This is an implementation of an interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game, in which the user can play with the computer using the camera.

1 - Trained a model on Teachable-Machine website
2 - Download the model from the "Tensorflow" tab in Teachable-Machine. The model should be named keras_model.h5 and the text file containing the labels should be named labels.txt.
    The files you are downloading contain the structure and the parameters of a deep learning model. They are not files that can be run, and they do not contain anything readable if you look inside.
